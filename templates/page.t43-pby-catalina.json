It was repurposed for stealth missions and became known as the aggressor, savior, and supplier in the Pacific Theater of Operations. The Black Cats were characterized by their matte black paint, allowing them to blend into the night sky as they executed low-flying missions against enemy vessels. A full moon was the ideal time for flight, as it illuminated the phosphorus wake, allowing pilots to spot enemy ships more clearly. The Black Cats—comprised of 14 squadrons—played a crucial role by damaging or sinking enemy cargo ships.</p>"
